#32Bits Serenity for Commodore Amiga<br/>

Hoi Amiga Fans,<br/>

Serenity is my first "Full Circle" ConceptDemo after I refurbished my first<br/>
 unexpanded A500 v5 R0CKL0BSTER last year..<br/>

Back in 96/97 I re-discovered an ancient "ALG0L4RHYTHM" while "sparring" with BlitzBasic2.1 on my A1200..<br/>
.. and that formed a rocksolid Base for my Serenity-Project.. "Deploying the Key to Endianity-Independent Computing"..<br/>
... with also a sneak Preview of the greatest Adventure I ever wanted to write/code.. but never found the Time..<br/>
.... after the Intro which includes some intrigueing ancient Scenery.. the Quantum-Momentum Stuff happens..<br/>
..... incorporating/engaging the Proto-Warp-Engine which spits out 123 perfectly timed Constants..<br/>
...... the Calculation can take up to 13 Hours as measured on the real A500..<br/>
....... so IT will be extremely welcome if you would post us your "Benchmarking Adventure"..<br/>

It had to run on that unexpanded A500 from floppy..<br/>
 and it ran acceptable in SAE with 2.4 ROM..<br/>
  yet failed to boot directly on vAmigaWeb with 3.0 ROM..<br/>
   (user has to type qpc to start)<br/>

That will be fixed with QPC v1.0.1. but has no priority..<br/>

Serenity shall be updated as an ongoing Project..<br/>
 Basic Routines replaced by ASM will show drastic Improvements..<br/>
  on the other hand.. that "boring" text Adventure with limited Gfx<br/>
   needs to be transformed into real Gameplay.. now we<br/>
    ditched SAE in favor of vAmigaWeb.. we shall see what is possible &<br/>
     do-able with our paleo-mathematical holy Grail as Beacon..<br/>

PTz()uAH<br/>

with kind regards.. Peter Slootbeek<br/>
