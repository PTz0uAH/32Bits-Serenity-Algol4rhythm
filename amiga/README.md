#Serenity.readme---------------------------------------------------------------
Hoi Amiga Fans,

Serenity is my first "Full Circle" ConceptDemo after I refurbished my first
 unexpanded A500 v5 R0CKL0BSTER last year..

Back in 96/97 I re-discovered an ancient "ALG0L4RHYTHM" while "sparring" with BlitzBasic2.1 on my A1200..
.. and that formed a rocksolid Base for my Serenity-Project.. "Deploying the Key to Endianity-Independent Computing"..
... with also a sneak Preview of the greatest Adventure I ever wanted to write/code.. but never found the Time..
.... after the Intro which includes some intrigueing ancient Scenery.. the Quantum-Momentum Stuff happens..
..... incorporating/engaging the Proto-Warp-Engine which spits out 123 perfectly timed Constants..
...... the Calculation can take up to 13 Hours as measured on the real A500..
....... so IT will be extremely welcome if you would post us your "Benchmarking Adventure"..

It had to run on that unexpanded A500 from floppy..
 and it ran acceptable in SAE with 2.4 ROM..
  yet failed to boot directly on vAmigaWeb with 3.0 ROM..
   (user has to type qpc to start)

That will be fixed with QPC v1.0.1. but has no priority..

Serenity shall be updated as an ongoing Project..
 Basic Routines replaced by ASM will show drastic Improvements..
  on the other hand.. that "boring" text Adventure with limited Gfx
   needs to be transformed into real Gameplay.. now we
    ditched SAE in favor of vAmigaWeb.. we shall see what is possible &
     do-able with our paleo-mathematical holy Grail as Beacon..

PTz()uAH

with kind regards.. Peter Slootbeek
